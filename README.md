The Fashion Recommender System is an AI-powered project designed to help users discover visually similar clothing items by simply uploading an image.  
It uses a pretrained ResNet50 model for deep feature extraction to understand the visual characteristics of fashion products.  
A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is then applied to match the uploaded image with a large dataset of fashion images, returning the top similar outfit recommendations instantly.  
Built with Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pickle, and Streamlit, the system provides a fast, interactive, and user-friendly interface suitable for modern e-commerce applications.  
Users can find alternatives to out-of-stock products, retailers can offer personalized recommendations, and developers can explore visual search technology for fashion.  
The project is modular and scalable, allowing future enhancements such as adding more categories like shoes, accessories, and bags.  
Integration with user profiles, purchase history, and cloud deployment is possible to create a fully functional real-world recommendation system.  
By combining deep learning and similarity search, this system demonstrates how AI can transform fashion shopping into a smarter, more personalized, and engaging experience.  
It is easy to run using `streamlit run app.py` and can be extended for larger datasets and real-time recommendations.  
Overall, this project serves as both a practical tool and a demonstration of AI-driven visual search in fashion.
